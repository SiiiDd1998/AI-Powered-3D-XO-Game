# AI Powered 3D XO Game
Computer Intelligently playing 3D XO Game

## How to play ?
The game is basically the same as regular tic-tac-toe: you try to win by getting three X’s or O’s in a row. The trick is, instead of one grid of nine squares, you have three grids of nine squares, all stacked on top of each other. A diagonal, horizontal, or vertical set of three lets you win, but since the game is 3-D, there are many more winning possibilities. After completing cube of 3*3*3, four new surfaces are formed from which winner of each face can be decided. Player winning maximum faces out of 7 wins the game.
